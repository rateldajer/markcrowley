### Required Background

The course will use concepts from ECE 203 and ECE 307 on Bayesian Probability and Statistics, these will be reviewed but familiarity will help significantly. All other concepts needed for the course will be introduced directly. Examples, assignments and projects will depend on programming ability in Python.

# Course Learning Objectives and Topic Details

### Learning Objectives

This course complements other AI courses in ECE by focussing on the
methods for representation and reasoning about uncertain knowledge for
the purposes of analysis and decision making. At each stage of the
course we will look at relevant applications of the methods being
discussed. 

For example, in 2016 the AI program "AlphaGO" defeated human world class
players of the game Go for the first time. This system requires many
different methods to enable reasoning, probabilistic inference, planning
and decision optimization. In this course we will build up the
fundamental knowledge about these components and how they combine
together to make such systems possible.

1. Identify and Explain the component theoretical concepts of Reinforcement Learning systems.

# COVID-19 Policies

<a name="covid"></a>

### Health and Safety

- see [these slides on university policy for COVID-19 safety](/DKMA/assets/pdf/winter_2022_safety_slides_for_instructors.pptx) once in-person classes begin again. 
- **Attendance: Students are to be instructed to attend only the section for which they are registered.** If you wish to attend a different section (less people are registered for section 2) you should transfer to that section using official means.
- **Absence:** Students ***shall not attend class if they are experiencing influenza-like illness***, have been in close contact with someone who is ill, or have travelled outside of Canada within the past 14 days. You will be able to engage with the course content online while reducing the risk of others becoming ill.
- **Face coverings:** Wearing of face-covering/mask is a **requirement** in all common areas on campus, including all indoor instructional spaces.
  - Students who will not wear masks will be asked to leave the classroom. If the student has a medical reason why they cannot wear a mask they should contact the professor electronically and provide proof of this.
  - As such, no food is allowed to be consumed in instructional space. Beverages are allowed if a straw is used or if the mask is lowered only for a brief period.
  - When a student asks or answers a question it may be difficult for them to be heard while wearing a mask. A student may briefly lower their mask to ask/answer the question and then the mask must be replaced.
- **Hand hygiene:** Students are expected to practice frequent hand hygiene (handwashing with soap and water or use of hand sanitizer), including immediately before coming into an instructional space
- **Seating:** Students are permitted to sit where they wish. Students are encouraged to sit with one seat left empty between them and other students when possible.
- **Student illness:** In the event of absence due to influenza-like illness or required self-isolation, students shall submit an Illness Self-declaration. Students can find the [Illness Self-declaration form in the Personal Information section of Quest](https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-my-illness). A doctor‚Äôs note for accommodation is not required.

### Fair Contingencies for Emergency Remote Teaching

We are facing unusual and challenging times. The course outline presents the instructor‚Äôs intentions for course assessments, their weights, and due dates in Winter 2022. **As best as possible, we will keep to the specified assessments, weights, and dates**. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to modify course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with **due and fair notice to students**. In the event of such challenges, **the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty**. 

## Wellness Support and Contact Information.

<a name="wellness"></a>

Petitions and Grievances, Section 4,
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/ Policies/policy70.htm. When in
doubt please be certain to contact the departments administrative
assistant who will provide further assistance.

**Discipline:** A student is expected to know what constitutes academic
integrity---check http: //www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/ to avoid
committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her
actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an
offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g.,
plagiarism, cheating) or about rules for group work/collaboration should
seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the
undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences
and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student
Discipline, http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm.
For typical penalties check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties,
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm.

**Appeals:** A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 (Student
Petitions and Grievances) (other than a petition) or Policy 71 (Student
Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes
he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student
Appeals) http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm.

**Note for Students with Disabilities:** The Office for Persons with
Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates
with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for
students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity
of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the
impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the beginning
of each academic term.
