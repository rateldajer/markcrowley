# ECE 457C - Reinforcement Learning

Offered Spring 2024 by Prof. Mark Crowley

### Course Description

Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL) theory and algorithms for learning decision-making policies in situations with uncertainty and limited information. Topics include Markov decision processes, classic exact/approximate RL algorithms such as value/policy iteration, Q-learning, State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), Temporal Difference (TD) methods, policy gradients, actor-critic, and Deep RL such as Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).

## Welcome Everyone! Let's Talk AI!

In this announcement:

- An Erratic Planned Lecture Schedule
  - First Lecture(s) : Monday May 6, 2024 - 3 hours on first day
- Course Communication Information
- Midterm Date

## An Erratic Planned Lecture Schedule

Due to having Monday lectures, and a large number of holidays, conferences, and other events, our "regular weekly schedule" is *far from regular*. 
- **"Regular" week:** Two 1.5 hour lectures a week on Mondays and Tuesdays.
- ButSome weeks we have a total of 1.5 hours of lecture, some weeks we have 6 hours
- Notably, the **very first week** we have
	- Monday (in person): 3 hours all at once on May 6 on the first day of class
	- Tuesday (cancelled): 1.5 hours are lecture are scheduled for May 7 but I will need to cancel it, see note below.
	- Wednesday (virtual): 1.5 hours 
	Since we'll be losing lecture in other weeks we will use the full hours in this first week to get off to a quick start! 

This means we'll be jumping right in with full content that first day. We will certainly have a break and some ice breaker discussions to let people chat, and discuss group partners, and ask general course questions.

So come to class Monday and be ready to talk about the big topics in Artificial Intelligence!

### Regular is as Regular Does...

### Additional Lecture Complications

In addition to the planned schedule, from time to I will need to cancel a lecture, or provide it virtually with as a live online lecture on Teams. This is partly because of a family health situation that requires me to be in Toronto a fair bit this term. One or two weeks I'll have be attending a conference and will switch to some lecture being virtual-live or virtual-pre-recorded.

If you have any concerns or inputs on the how I can best do all of this in a way that supports your learning, please do contact me.

## Course Communication Processes

Hi Everyone!
Looking forward to another fun spring term talking about one of the most interesting areas of modern AI these days, Reinforcement Learning!
We'll be using Piazza and Learn for discussion and content, you know the drill by now!
News and announcements will be posted on Learn and piazza, as well as initially on my website for the course (https://markcrowley.ca/rlcourse/) for people who aren't registered yet.

`Boilerplate:`
We'll be conducting all class-related discussion here this term. The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept. For course communications, you can even do so anonymously to the course staff and only the TAs and Prof will know who it is. 

**Important:**
For direct contact with the Prof or TAs on individual issues on anything personal or administrative, please use private piazza messages so that all three of us get a chance to respond. Prof. Crowley is "bad at email" *(...it's true)*, so it might get missed. If you really have a critical time issue, or you don't want the TA's to see the message (for any reason at all), then you should send Prof. Crowley a direct message on Teams chat. But please use this method only when critical.



## Midterm

The course will have a Midterm Exam and a Final Exam this year. The Midterm is already scheduled :

- **Midterm Exam:** June 17,  11am to 12:15pm, in room E7 4043 
- Full ECE Midterm Schedule : https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/midterm-schedule-0
