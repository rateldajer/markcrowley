## Final Exam Scope

**Scope:** Content from slides and lectures, but focussed on the new concepts learned since the midterm.

## Final Exam"Cheat-Sheet" and Exam Materials

As for the midterm, you can use two sheets of paper (US Letter or A4), double sided, to create notes on it of your own creation. I encourage handwritten because when I've allowed it to be printed in the past, many people end up just getting a shared document from their peers, and the best thing about a "cheat sheet" is how much you remember and learn by making it yourself. Studies show that you learn much better from notes written by hand under space or time constraints than electronic reference documents. You can also your midterm cheat-sheet again, so a total of four pages.

- Pen and pencil (a pencil is suggested for multiple choice questions so you can erase it if needed).
- Calculator - for arithmetic calculations
- Your midterm cheatsheet, up to two pages of notes for first half of course
- You final exam cheatsheet, up to two additional pages of notes
- Valid UWaterloo student ID (WatCard)



## Day of the Exam Information

Here are some administrative announcements to help make today's midterm go more smoothly.

- you will receive seating information indicating your room and seat

   in rooms the Physical Activities Complex (PAC 1,3,5)

- Rules for the exam:

  - questions and clarification
    - given the large number of students and locations, please refrain from questions unless completely necessary
    - if you are unsure of something you can state down your assumption on the paper and we will see it in the scanned crowdmark grading
  - fill out the bubble sheet at the back carefully to answer the True/False questions, but also circle your answer choice on the answer sheet itself
  - all other questions are answered directly on the answer sheet
  - if you need extra space, use the additional pages for this at the back, and be sure to indicate this in the original question space.
  - If you do need to the washroom during the test, that is fine, raise your hand and a course staff will escort one person at a time to the outside of the washrooms.
