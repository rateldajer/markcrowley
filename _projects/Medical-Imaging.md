This project spans multiple modalities of medical imaging and multiple types of modelling to empower medical experts.


**Digital Pathology** - In this dataset we have looked at NLP methods for analyzing medical reports, Deep Learning methods for classifying images, and Manifold Learning methods to extract compact embeddings for using in classifiers and search engines.

**Alzheimer's Classification** - learning predictive classification models for diffusion MRI data to provide decision support for degenerative brain diseases using Deep Neural Network methods currently only used for 2D image classification. This domain is challenging due to the 3D structure of the data as well as the non-visual properties which do not necessarily carry over from other domains.
