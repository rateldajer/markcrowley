The [Real-Time Embedded Software Group](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/) and [UWECEML](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/mcrowley/lab) labs at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the University of Waterloo are working to conduct a study on **driving behaviour**. This project is part of a research collaboration between the University of Waterloo and [Magna International Inc.](https://www.magna.com/) to develop a driving model for self-driving vehicles based on learning from human driver behaviour on roads using a variety of automotive sensors, data fusion and artificial intelligence algorithms. The goal is to create a comfortable in-vehicle experience when a self-driving mode is engaged. The project requires monitoring and recording the driving behaviour of 100 drivers using a specially equipped SUV (LiDAR, Radar, Cameras and more) in order to have sufficient data to create a self-learning model using machine learning algorithms.

**Get Involved:** See the [project webpage](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/mcrowley/dblstudy) to find out more or to sign up to be a driving participant in our study.

## Learning Problems

**Problem 1**: Given an observed driving execution with a known driving plan, efficiently and effectively *extract* a driver behavior model.

**Problem 2**: Given a driving plan and a driver model, *predict* the vehicle state at points on the driving plan.
