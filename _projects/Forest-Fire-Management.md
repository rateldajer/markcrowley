The task of Forest Fire Management presents a number of unique challenges which push the boundaries of what is possible with existing AI/ML algorithms. These include the importance of considering:
- multiple spatial-temporal scales at all times
- tradeoffs between individual and social good
- paucity of supervised training data
- coordinating decisions amongst a large number of agents (distributed nationwide) without frequent, extensive communication.

Relevant work to this project has been progressing recently on theoretical models of multi-agent decision making. 
This research explores the intersection of theory in the field of **Game Theory** and **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)](/marl/)**, both of which study how multiple agents can adapt and optimize their decision making policies in response to changes in the world around them and actions of other decision makers.  



### News

- **ML for Forest Fire Journal Paper:** In 2020, in collaboration with some other investigators in this strategic network, we published a review article in the *Environmental Reviews* journal \cite{jain2020review} analysing the relevance of various ML algorithms to the domain and exhaustively surveying and analysing the existing research using ML for forest fire management.
- **NSERC/CANADA WILDFIRE STRATEGIC NETWORK**: In 2019, an NSERC Strategic Network grant was confirmed in which we are involved to support computational research in to Forest Fire Management practices. This includes the AI/ML/RL focus of our research along with our colleague in computer science Prof. Kate Larson.
- In 2019, we were awarded a computing grant on the topic of 
Wildfire management: Disaster response, climate change" from **Waterloo Artificial Intelligence Institute (WAII)** in affiliation with the **Microsoft "AI for Social Good"** program.
