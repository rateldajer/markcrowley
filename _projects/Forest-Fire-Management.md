The broad domain of [Sustainable Forest Management](/forest-management/), includes a wide variety of tasks and challenges. Prof. Crowley's PhD research focussed on this domain from a harvesting pointing of view utilizing probabilistic modelling, simulation, and reinforcement learning. More recently, the lab carries out some research on the task of [Forest Wildfire Management](/forest-wildfire) which presents a number of unique challenges which push the boundaries of what is possible with existing AI/ML algorithms.
