<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>Introduction to <a href="/reinforcement-learning/">Reinforcement Learning</a> (RL) theory and algorithms for learning decision-making policies in situations with uncertainty and limited information. Topics include Markov decision processes, classic exact/approximate RL algorithms such as value/policy iteration, Q-learning, State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), Temporal Difference (TD) methods, policy gradients, actor-critic, and Deep RL such as Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).</p>

<h3 id="required-background">Required Background</h3>

<p>The course will use concepts from ECE 203 and ECE 307 on Bayesian Probability and Statistics, these will be reviewed but familiarity will help significantly. All other concepts needed for the course will be introduced directly. Examples, assignments and projects will depend on programming ability in Python.</p>

      <li><strong>Live Lecture/Review/Discussion Session - ** Every **TBD</strong> there will be a live session with the Prof which will be:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Either</em> a live lecture with new/revised content from what is on YouTube. Lectures will be recorded and available later on YouTube.</li>
          <li><em>Or</em> a live discussion session to review the content from last week’s self-study, working through problems, answering questions, breaking out for discussions. These sessions will be recorded and remain available on LEARN during the term.</li>

<h2 id="course-learning-objectives-and-topic-details">Course Learning Objectives and Topic Details</h2>

<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>This course complements other AI courses in ECE by focussing on the
methods for representation and reasoning about uncertain knowledge for
the purposes of analysis and decision making. At each stage of the
course we will look at relevant applications of the methods being
discussed.</p>

<p>For example, in 2016 the AI program “AlphaGO” defeated human world class
players of the game Go for the first time. This system requires many
different methods to enable reasoning, probabilistic inference, planning
and decision optimization. In this course we will build up the
fundamental knowledge about these components and how they combine
together to make such systems possible.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify and Explain the component theoretical concepts of Reinforcement Learning systems.</li>
  <li>Implement or instantiate using a library any of the core Reinforcement Learning algorithms on a variety of domains.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the performance of a particular RL system on a given domain through proper experimental design, statistical analysis and visualization.</li>

<h2 id="general-university-of-waterloo-guidelines">General University of Waterloo Guidelines:</h2>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> In order to maintain a culture of academic
integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected
to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. Check
http://www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/ for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Grievance:</strong> A student who believes that a decision affecting some
aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may
have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70, Student
Petitions and Grievances, Section 4,
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/ Policies/policy70.htm. When in
doubt please be certain to contact the departments administrative
assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Discipline:</strong> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic
integrity—check http: //www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/ to avoid
committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her
actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an
offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g.,
plagiarism, cheating) or about rules for group work/collaboration should
seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the
undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences
and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student
Discipline, http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm.
For typical penalties check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties,
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm.</p>

<p><strong>Appeals:</strong> A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 (Student
Petitions and Grievances) (other than a petition) or Policy 71 (Student
Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes
he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student
Appeals) http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm.</p>

<p><strong>Note for Students with Disabilities:</strong> The Office for Persons with
Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates
with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for
students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity
of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the
impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the beginning
of each academic term.</p>
