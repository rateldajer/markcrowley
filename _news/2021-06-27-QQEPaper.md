Our new paper [Quantile--Quantile Embedding for Distribution Transformation and Manifold Embedding ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266682702100044X?via%3Dihub){% cite ghojogh2021mlwajrnl %} on a novel method for shaping distributions using a new twist on classic quantile-quantile plotting methods has been accepted for publication in the Elsevier journal Machine Learning with Applications (MLWA). 

This paper comes out of the [Manifold Learning](/manifold-learning/) research topic in out lab led by postdoc Benyamin Ghojogh and was one of the components of his recent completed [PhD thesis](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16813) {% cite ghojoghthesis2021 %} here in the lab.
