==TODO: update news==

There are a few news items to share from the lab this month.

### ICML 2023 Conference

Next week Prof. Crowley will be in Hawai'i for the ICML 2023 conference where he's presenting the paper ==***"Learning from Multiple Independent Advisors in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning"***== {% cite ganapathi-subramanian2023aamas %} which looks at the problem of simultaneously learning from multiple independent advisors in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting. The approach leverages a two-level Q-learning architecture extended to multi-agent settings and includes algorithms for incorporating a set of advisors by both evaluating the advisors at each state and subsequently using the advisors to guide action selection. There are also great theoretical convergence and sample complexity guarantees as well as empirical validation through simulation experiments.




### ChemGymRL Presentation at ICML 2023 Workshop

We are very excited to present version 1 of our ChemGymRL simulation framework for RL for Digital Chemistry at the 

Related to our ongoing NRC funded project on [Digital Chemistry and Material Design](/chemgymrl/) we have recently posted a paper preprint on Arxiv titled ***"ChemGymRL: An Interactive Framework for Reinforcement Learning for Digital Chemistry"*** {% cite beeler2023arxiv %}. The paper is a detailed introduction to the open-source simulation framework and experimental results on standard RL algorithms.
