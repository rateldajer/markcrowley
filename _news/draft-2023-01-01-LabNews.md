### Where are they Now?
The end of the year makes one wistful for the past, where are those bright students of yesteryear now? Or...yesterday in my case.
- What's Takin up to? - TODO
- Sriram - After successfully, even decisively you'd say, defending his PhD thesis earlier in the year, Sriram is now already hard at work at the Vector Institute in Toronto working with Prof. Pascal Poupart (UWaterloo) and Prof. TODO (Univ. of Toronto).
- Benyamin - TODO


### Manifold Learning Book finally released
> {% reference ghojogh2022springerbook %}

Our long-awaited, much discusse (by us at least) textbook on **Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction** has now been published officially via Springer Nature and os available on Amazon and other fine booksellers {;)}. 

The reglferemce ans teaching textbook is on the broad topic area of my former PhD student Benyamin Ghojogh's thesis. Benyamin led the massive effort involved in the completion of this textbook. We're confident it will be a fantastic resource for students and researchers wanting a wide view of this field but also one built from the ground up from the fundamentals at each step.

These are fundamental tools and concepts for all data analysis and machine learning professionals. So of you're interested in a deep dive into this important area, and take a look at our book.
