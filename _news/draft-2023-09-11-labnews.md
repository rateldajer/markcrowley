## Coffee panel
Last month I had a chance to combined two things I like a lot: Coffee and Artificial Intelligence!

<img src="../assets/img/zoom-coffee-chat.png" align="right" style="zoom: 67%;" />

I recently did a panel discussion at the invitation of the Coffee Association of Canada (CAC), and the topic was on the use of Artificial Intelligence in various parts of the industry. 
I learned a lot in fact about what was being done with coffee and AI, at the most fundamental chemical level, very exciting. I also gave some assessment of AI in that industry, the economy, and the world in general. 

**[Update:]** you can listen see a summary of the discussion in [industry news piece](https://www.foodserviceandhospitality.com/cac-highlights-the-impact-of-ai-on-coffee-during-its-monthly-webinar-series/?cn-reloaded=1) and also includes a link to the video.
