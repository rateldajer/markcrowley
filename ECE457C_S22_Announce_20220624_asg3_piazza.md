## Announcements - June 24, 2022

Hi Everyone,
I know it's a busy time for everyone, so I hope things are going along as smoothly as they can. I have some announcements and tips to help resolve things quicker for this course below:

### Assignment 2 Dropboxes

- A number of people had trouble with submitting their code for Assignment 2 to LEARN, there weren't enough groups there for everyone. I've corrected this now, so if you were not able to submit your code to the dropbox yet, you can do so now. For anyone who didn't have code, the TAs will circle back and look again.

### Contacting Prof/TAs With Issues
- You should (almost) always ask questions on piazza, you can use the *private message* mode to ensure that only the TAs and Prof see your message.
  - If it's for the Prof's eye's only and it's urgent
    - ...and only in this case...
    - You should *also* send a message on Teams to Prof. Crowley or else he might not see the email

### Assignment 3

- Asg3 is now released and the deadline is July 26, 2022, the last day of classes: https://git.uwaterloo.ca/ece457c/asg3-s22
- There are some options about how to do the assignment, including choosing to compare at least three library implementations or create your own from scratch.
- Be sure to try loading up slimevolleygym (the new second environment) as soon as possible to get through installation and library issues right at the start. If you leave it until the end and can't get tensorflow installed you're going to have a lot of unnecessary stress.
- Setting up some of these libraries and using the OpenAI Gym API, especially with our MazeEnv class, can be tricky, so *help each other on piazza* and we will monitor and try to improve the whole system for everyone. I'd rather everyone get past these library and installation issues as quickly as possible so they can focus on programming and training of the RL agents themselves.
