My research seeks dependable and transparent ways to augment human decision making in complex domains in the presence of spatial structure, large scale streaming data, or uncertainty.  My focus is on developing new algorithms within the fields of **[Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement-learning)**, **[Deep Learning](deep-learning)** and **[Ensemble Methods](ensemble-methods)**, and **[Manifold Learning (Dimensionality Reduction)](manifold-learning)** as well as other [Research Topics](/topics/).  
I often work in collaboration with researchers in applied fields such as  **[Computational Sustainability](computational-sustainability)** (including [Sustainable Forest Management](forest-management)), **[Autonomous Driving](autonomous-driving)**, **AI for Physics** (including [Combustion Modelling](Combustion) and [Digital Chemistry](chemgymrl)) and **[Medical Imaging](medical-imaging)**.

Note, that I do not take on many *incoming graduate students*, so if you are hoping to join my lab as a graduate student for research please [read this note](/joining-my-lab/).

Besides my [publications](publications), you can find my thoughts on Artificial Intellgience, Machine Learning and how technology and science are advancing on my blog [Computationally Thinking](http://computationallythinking.com/) (updated intermittently) or through social media as **@compthink** [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/compthink)(at least for now) or increasingly, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@compthink" rel="me">on Mastodon</a>. I'm always happy to talk to people about my research, or the impact of AI/ML/RL on our world and its role in our society in the future.
