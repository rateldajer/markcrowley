The global interest in AI/ML/RL is *infectious* and it is *truly an exciting time* to be in research in this field. 

For that reason, interested students should be aware that **I <i>very rarely</i> accept new graduate students** other than *students I already know* through courses I teach or other *interactions in person*, such as from conferences. 

Unfortunately, if you email me with your interest in graduate school I *probably* will not even be able to see it in my *waves and waves of emails* in order to reply. So, I *apologize* for that up front and *wish you luck* in your search for graduate school positions.
