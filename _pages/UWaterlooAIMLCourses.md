# AIML Courses at UWaterloo

## ECE Courses (let's start here)



## Engineering Programs

### MSCI Data Analytics

- MSCI grad diploma - https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/future-graduate-students/graduate-diploma-data-analytics



### More info from Email to MEng student with question - July 28, 2022 

So, the degree you are doing is MEng, which is course based.

This requires 8 courses total, and 5 of these must be in the ECE department itself. The remaining 3 courses can be taken from any courses offered by departments in the faculties of Math (such as Computer Science, or Statistics), Engineering or Science.

 

If you are actually signed up for the Specialization in AI/ML

then those 5 courses must be taken from the list described on the website (https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/engineering/department-electrical-and-computer-engineering/master-engineering-meng-electrical-and-computer-engineering#artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning).

 

The remaining 3 courses, just like any MEng degree, can be taken from other parts of campus. But, you could also just take them from the same list. 

 

If none of those work for you, then I'd suggest the following.

Take a look at courses offered in the following departments and look for terms such as (artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistical inference/modelling/learning, data analytics, optimization, search, classification, etc.):

\- System Design Engineering - lots of AI courses and exciting applications

\- Computer Science (note: this is in the Faculty of Math at UWaterloo) they have some very good AI courses, although it will be hard to get in since they are in high demand and listed initially for CS students.

\- Statistics and Actuarial Science Department (

\- Management Science (https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/future-graduate-students/graduate-diploma-data-analytics) - they are a business focussed engineering school, they have quite a few AI/ML courses that are probably less technical but very practical

\- The Waterloo AI Institute has a page on departments and schools with some AI courses - https://uwaterloo.ca/artificial-intelligence-institute/academic-programs

 

\- you might also want to look up:

  \- the student run Data Science Club (https://www.instagram.com/uwaterloodsc/?hl=en)

   \- a lot of UWaterloo students use Reddit to discuss courses, you might find other answers there as well from current students

## Data Analysis and Machine Learning (DKMA)

Engineers encounter data in many of their tasks, whether the sources of this data may be from experiments, databases, computer files or the Internet. There is a dire need for effective methods to model and analyze the data and extract useful knowledge from it and to know how to act on it. In this course you will learn the fundamental tools for assessing, preparing and analyzing data.

## Reinforcement Learning

One of my core research areas is into understanding the computational mechanisms that can enable learning to perform complex tasks primarily from experience and feedback. This topic, called ***Reinforcement Learning***,  has a complex history tying fields as diverse as neuroscience, behavioural and development psychology, economics and computer science. I approach it as a computational researcher aiming to build Artificial Intelligence agents that learn to way Humans do, not by any correspondence of their "brain" and it "neural" structure by the *algorithms they both use to learn to act in a complex, mysterious world.*
