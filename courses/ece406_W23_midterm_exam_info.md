# Midterm Exam Information

The midterm will be held on ***\*Thursday March 2 at 4pm\****. You should get a notice next week about assigned seating in a lecture hall in E7 4th or 5th floor.

***\*Topics:\**** Everything up to, and including, Dijkstra's algorithm on page 121 of the slides, can be on the midterm.

Some example questions will be posted on LEARN today, there will also be other types of questions shorter than these that are multiple choice, matching algorithms to problems, commenting on the design of an algorithm design choice and analysing the complexity of an algorithm.



## Midterm and Final Exam"Cheat-Sheets" and Exam Materials

For both the midterm and the final exam, you can bring in your own created notes, but no books or other materials.

- For the midterm you can bring in two, double-sided 8.5x11 sheets of paper
- For the final exam you can bring those two sheets again plus and additional two sheets

You can bring a calculator for small calculations, *note that you cannot use your phone for this*.

I encourage you to create the notes by hand, or on a tablet and printed, the best thing about a "cheat sheet" is how much you remember and learn by *making it yourself*. Studies show that you learn much better from notes written by hand under space or time constraints than electronic reference documents. Also, you should not just take slides from the lectures, shrink them down and print that.

Other allowed materials:

- Pen and pencil (a mechanical pencil is suggested for multiple choice questions so you can erase it if needed).

- An eraser :)

- Calculator - for arithmetic calculations

- ***\*(required)\**** UWaterloo student ID (WatCard)

  

## Midterm Information

Here are some administrative announcements to help make today's midterm go more smoothly.

- midterm is today at 4pm-5:20pm (hopefully you were aware of that :p )

- you should have already received 

  seating information indicating your room and seat

   in rooms in E7 4th and 5th floors

  - if you did not receive that then meet outside E7 4053 and TAs will help you find your room and seat

- Once you come in to your room please do the following:

  - silence your phone
  - leave your coat, bags, phone, etc near one of the walls of the classroom
  - keep your writing utensils, calculator, two pages of notes, student id, water etc.
  - find your seat
  - fill out your name and info on the exam paper
  - do not open your exam until the course staff say to start
  - breathe

- Rules for the exam:

  - questions and clarification
    - given the large number of students and locations, please refrain from questions unless completely necessary
    - if you are unsure of something you can state down your assumption on the paper and we will see it in the scanned crowdmark grading
  - fill out the bubble sheet at the back carefully to answer the True/False questions, but also circle your answer choice on the answer sheet itself
  - all other questions are answered directly on the answer sheet
  - if you need extra space, use the additional pages for this at the back, and be sure to indicate this in the original question space.
  - The exam time is short, just 1hour 20 min, and it probably will be even shorter than that to complete. So try to use the washroom beforehand to avoid disturbances during the test.
  - If you do need to the washroom during the test, that is fine, raise your hand and a course staff will escort one person at a time to the outside of the washrooms.
