In the broadest terms my research spans the areas of ***[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](/artificial-intelligence/)*** and ***[Machine Learning (ML)](/machine-learning/)*** which can be seen highly related, independent, or identical research fields depending on who you are.

My approach to understanding the relationship is summarized in this picture which I use in [my courses](/teaching/) on the subject.
