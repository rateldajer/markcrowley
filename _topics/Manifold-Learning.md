Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction are vast areas of study in Math and Computer Science. The task is to find ways to determine the essential relationships and structure of a dataset. Researchers in this area looks at ways to automatically extract meaningful features, dimensions or subspaces from data in order to build better models, expand data, reduce data, etc.


The recent focus on **Deep Learning** seems to raise the question whether
dedicated research on **[Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction](manifold-learning.md)** are still required as their own pursuit since. After all, some form of Encoder-Decoder neural network could always be devised as a replacement.
While such systems work well given the right training process and enough data, there is also certainly a role to
be played by interpretable models built on solid statistical concepts. 

Extraction of lower-dimensional representations of data can allow more compact storage or transmission and
also improve the performance of other ML tasks such as classification and regres_sion, as the more compact representation
must necessarily encode the most important relationships to maintain accuracy. 

We have an exciting group of work which has been published in recent years on this topic which you can see below in the Publications list.

### Upcoming Textbook on Manifold Learning!

This work has culiminated recently in the graduation of my first Doctoral student, [Benyamin Ghojogh]({{ site.data.coauthors["Benyamin Ghojogh"].url }}), in April 2021 with his thesis encompassing many of these advances.
Dr. Ghojogh continued as a postdoc in my lab until 2022 and now works in industry. In late 2022 we will publish, via Springer, a new textbook on **"Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction"** {% cite ghojogh2022springerbook %} written in collaboration with Prof. Ali Godsi andd Prof. Fakhri Karray.
