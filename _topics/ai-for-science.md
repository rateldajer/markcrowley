What could be more important that using AI to learn how to do science more effectively, to learn what doing science really means, to update good methods for modelling our universe and make great?


In my lab we have done work on a few focussed topics in this area:

- [Combustion Modelling](/combustion-modelling/) - We used Deep Learning to greatly improve the speed and scale possible for existing flamelet estimation models.

- [Material Design](/chemgymrl/) - In this ongoing work with the National Research Council, we are investigating exciting ways to apply Reinforcement Learning to the problem of material design and digital chemistry.
