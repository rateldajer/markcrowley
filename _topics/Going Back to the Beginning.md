## Going Back to the Beginning
Alan M. Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician who founded computer science.

He made monumental contributions in:
- **Definition of computing**: What is a computer?
- **Algorithm Complexity**: How long will it take to compute something?
- **Codebreaking**: What are they saying?
- **Artificial Intelligence**: what does it mean to be able to “think”?

Ironically, Turing isn't famous for a great deal of foundational work in AI methods themselves, but he is famous for a simple thought experiment he proposed in 1950 for thinking about how intelligence or thinking in a machine might be identified by defining a kind of baseline level for intelligence. This test has since been called the "Turing Test", although of course, Turing himself didn't call it that. 

### How the Turing Test works:
The main idea of the Turing Test is essentially, "If a computer can fool you into thinking it is intelligent, then *maybe* it is...".


We encounter examples of the Turing Test Today all the time. CAPTCHA Images - many times you need to enter an answer to a question to log in to a website, this is a CAPTCHA test. The CAPTCHA test is just a Turing Test in reverse. The system wants you to prove you are human, and so presents you with a task that computers are bad at completing. 

The problem is, computers get better every day at completing complex tasks, so the captchas need to also become more complex. It's a kind of arms race of hiding, and verifying, if the user is an automated bot attempting to log in illegitimately, a legitimate, human user.

Example CAPTCHAS:
- blurred text 
- Those tricky login images with Street signs, motorcycles, stairs...
- a new one I saw that asked me to select nodes in a graph based on some abstract concept (*i was worried there for a minute*)
- [ ] "I am human checkbox" - Sometimes we just see this checkbox, is that a Turing Test? *Kind of, clicking doesn't do any test, but in the background Google (INSERT  ALT GLOBAL CONGLOMERATE HERE) will examine your use profile, browser cookies etc., to determine is you likely human.*
